## Introduction

Break It is a JavaScipt block breaker game. Users move a paddle back
and forth across the screen to hit a ball to break bricks while avoiding letting the ball drop. Play the current version [here](https://jdorn-break-it.onrender.com).

I drew design inspiration from Atari's arcade game Breakout, and
end3r's [game development workshop](https://github.com/end3r/Gamedev-Canvas-workshop/blob/gh-pages/lesson10.html). Starting from that base I added a custom design with Gimp and CSS styles, ES6 modules, config to build with Webpack and deploy on Render, and a Node Express server. Sounds effects are provided by [Juhani Junkala](https://juhanijunkala.com/).
